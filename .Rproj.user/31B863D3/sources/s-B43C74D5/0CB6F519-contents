# Translator #

### What it does ###
This package was built in the context of research into eHealth interventions, particularly for ones that use messages that are sent to users to incentivise them to engage in healthier behaviours. These are often large projects where collaboration between different research labs, universities, and countries is crucial. Therefore, it is important to be able to easily translate these messages that are created into various languages and store them in a format that is easy to work with.

### How it works ###
This package uses Deepl (https://www.deepl.com/translator) API to translate text into various languages. Deepl uses neural machine translation to provide very accurate translations into various languages. The output is then stored in a database that can be accessed by the user. 

### How it was built ###
This package was built with RStudio and will have a R Shinny App user interface.
