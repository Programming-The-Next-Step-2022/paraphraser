\item{split_sentences}{Optional argument to determine whether the translator
should first split the \code{input_text} into sentences. This is enabled by
default. The possible options are: 0 for no splitting at all meaning the whole
input is treated as a single sentence, 1 (default) for splitting at punctuation
and new lines, and "nonewlines" for splitting only at punctuation and ignoring
new lines.}

\item{preserve_formatting}{Optional argument to determine whether the translator
should respect the original formatting of the \code{input_text}. Possible
aspects affected by this formatting include punctuation and upper or lower
cases at the start and end of sentences. Possible options are 0 (default) for
no formatting, or 1 for formatting.}
