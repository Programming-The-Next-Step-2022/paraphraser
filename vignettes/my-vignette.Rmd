## Translate Function

Translate function translates text into a target language by using Deepl's API (<https://www.deepl.com/>) to provide high quality translations. \
Deepl uses (...). \
\
**Arguments:** \
* `input_text`: The string you wish to translate \
* `target_language`: The language code of language you wish to translate your string(s) to. Note that it must be an accepted language code in a string format and in upper case to be accepted. For example, "BG" for Bulgarian. The help file lists all accepted language codes. \
* `source_language`: Optional argument to set the language of the `input_text`. If this is not chosen, then the translator will attempt to detect the language automatically. Once again, an accepted language code must be used. Note that the language codes accepted for `target_language` are not exactly the same as the ones accepted for `source_language`. There are only minor differences, for example, the `target_language` codes include both Portugal Portuguese ("PT-PT") and Brazilian Portuguese ("PT-BR") while the `source_language` codes do not make this distinction ("PT"). The help file lists all the options. \
* `formality`: Optional argument in case you want to receive a more formal or informal translation than default. This argument is only accepted in a smaller number of languages (German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, and Russian). Options are "default", "more", and "less". \
* `split_sentences`: Optional argument that determines whether the translator should split the `input_text` into sentences or treat the whole input as a single sentence. Default is set to `1`, meaning splitting occurs after punctuation and new lines. Other options are `0` meaning no splitting at all, and `"nonewlines"` meaning splitting only happens after punctuation. \
* `preserve_formatting`: Optional argument to determine whether the original format of the `input_text` should be kept, which is the default setting, or whether the translator should format the text. For example, by including punctuation and upper or lower cases when needed. Options are `0` for default and `1` for formatting. \

### Examples

**Using only the essential arguments:** \

```{r translate}
translate(input_text = "Hello world!", 
          target_language = "RU")

```
This example shows how easy it is to use this function especially when you do not need to specify any additional arguments. The translator detects the `source_language` automatically. \


**Using optional arguments:** \

```{r}
translate(input_text = "The cat jumped over the fox. then he fell", 
          target_language = "PT-BR",
          source_language = "EN",
          formality = "less",
          split_sentences = 1,
          preserve_formatting = 0)

translate(input_text = "The cat jumped over the fox. then he fell", 
          target_language = "PT-BR",
          source_language = "EN",
          formality = "more",
          split_sentences = 0,
          preserve_formatting = 1)
```

The two examples above show how the translation can look quite different depending on what the additional optional arguments are set as. \ 


Note how in the first one, the sentences were split (`split_sentences = 1`), the formatting was not changed as the second sentence was not formatted with upper case (`preserve_formatting = 0`), and a more informal verb, "pulou", is used for "jumped" (`formality = "less"`). \


In contrast, in the second example, the sentences were merged into a single sentence (`split_sentences = 0`), but a comma was added in between them to format it correctly (`preserve_formatting = 1`), and a more formal verb, "saltou", was used for "jumped" (`formality = "more"`). \
