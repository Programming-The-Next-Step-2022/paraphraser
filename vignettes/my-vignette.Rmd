## Package
This package was built in the context of research into eHealth interventions but can be used in all sorts of contexts that require nuanced translations. \
It consists of two functions:\
* The main function is the `translate()` function, which translates `input_text` in a `source_language` to `output_text` in a `target_language`, with additional optional arguments to further customise this translation. \
* The second function is `shiny_translate()` function. This function takes no arguments and simply renders the shiny app that was built to display the `translate()` function in a user friendly way. \


```{r setup}
library("project.margarida")
```


## Translate Function

Translate function translates text into a target language by using Deepl's API (<https://www.deepl.com/>) to provide high quality translations. \
Deepl uses neural networks in their machine translation to capture more nuances in text input than other translators. \
\
**Arguments:** \
* `input_text`: The string to be translated. \
* `target_language`: The language code of the language the user wishes to translate their text to. Note that it must be an accepted language code in a string format and in upper case to be accepted. For example, `"BG"` for Bulgarian. The help file lists all accepted language codes. \
* `source_language`: Optional argument to set the language of the `input_text`. If this is not chosen, then the translator will attempt to detect the language automatically. Once again, an accepted language code must be used. Note that the language codes accepted for `target_language` are not exactly the same as the ones accepted for `source_language`. There are only minor differences, for example, the `target_language` codes include both Portugal Portuguese (`"PT-PT"`) and Brazilian Portuguese (`"PT-BR"`) while the `source_language` codes do not make this distinction (`"PT"`). The help file lists all the options. \
* `formality`: Optional argument in case you want to receive a more formal or informal translation than default. This argument is only accepted in a set of languages (German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, and Russian). Options are "default", "more", and "less". \
* `preserve_formatting`: Optional argument to determine whether the original format of the `input_text` should be kept, which is the default setting, or whether the translator should format the text. For example, by including punctuation and upper or lower cases when needed. Options are `1` for default and `0` for changing formatting. \

\
**Output:**\
Just calling the function will print a list with 4 main outputs: \
* `input_text`. \ 
\
* `source_language`. \
* `output_text`: this is the translated version of the `input_text`. \ 
\
* `target_language`. \
It will additional return the value of the class attribute for this list object, which is called "translation".

### Examples

**Using Only the Essential Arguments:** \

This example shows how easy it is to use this function especially when you do not need to specify any additional arguments. The translator detects the `source_language` automatically. It gives you back the input text and source language it detected (or you specified) and the target language you have picked along with the output text (the translation). \

```{r translate}
translate(input_text = "Hello world!", 
          target_language = "RU")
```
\
Here you can see another example that also shows how you can access only the output you need, rather than getting a list of of all that the function returns. \

```{r}
translation_1 <- translate(input_text = "The red fox jumped over the black cat",
                           target_language = "LV")
translation_1$output_text
```

\

**Using Optional Arguments:** \

The two examples below show how the translation can look quite different depending on what the additional optional arguments are set as. \ 


Note how in the first one, the formatting was not changed as the sentences were not formatted with upper case (`preserve_formatting = 1`), and a more informal verb, "pulou", is used for "jumped" (`formality = "less"`). \


```{r}
translation_2 <- translate(input_text = "the cat jumped over the fox. then he fell.", 
          target_language = "PT-BR",
          source_language = "EN",
          formality = "less",
          preserve_formatting = 1)
translation_2$output_text
```


In contrast, in the second example, the first letter is now uppercase (`preserve_formatting = 1`), and a more formal verb, "saltou", was used for "jumped" (`formality = "more"`). \

```{r}
translation_3 <- translate(input_text = "the cat jumped over the fox. then he fell.", 
          target_language = "PT-BR",
          source_language = "EN",
          formality = "more",
          preserve_formatting = 0)
translation_3$output_text
```
\


## Shiny App Function: User Interface

The user interface was created with Shiny from R Studio (<https://shiny.rstudio.com/>). \
You can call the `shiny_translate()` function to launch the shiny app that will allow you to translate your text.\
\

**Arguments:** \
This function does not take any arguments. \

\
**Output:**\
Calling the function will automatically launch the shiny app from your R Studio. There is no other output. \
\
Here you can see the idea behind the user interface and how it takes user's input to display output.
![User Interface](/Users/margaridamoreirasilva/Documents/GitHub/translate_/screenshots/diagram.png){width=80%} \
\
Elements:\

* **Input text box:** user can write text which is then taken as the `input_text` argument of the `translate()` function. The result of this function will be outputed on the opposite side text box. \ 
\
* **Source language drop down menu:** This takes user input as the user can click on it to see all of the different language options. The default is set to "detect language" meaning the `translate()` function will set the `source_language` argument to NULL, and recognise what language the `input_text` is in. \
\
* **Detected language text:** This is reactive text that will output to the user the source language currently at use by the `translate()`function. This can be automatically detected by the function, if "detect language" is selected, or specified by the user by using the drop down menu right above it. \
\
* **Target language drop down menu:** This is the same as the source language menu, except that there is no "detect language" option. The default is just the first language of the language list (i.e. Bulgarian), but this can be changed by the user which will immediately change the `output_text`. \
\
* **Output text box:** takes no user input but outputs the `output_text` from the `translate()` function that is called by the shiny app when text is given by the user in the input text box. \
\
* **Formality button:** this is a radio button where the user can specify whether they want default translation, a more formal translation, or a less formal translation. This input is taken as the `formality` argument of the `translate()` function. This is a reactive button so it will immediately update the output text. This button will only appear if a target language out of a specific set of languages is selected.. \
\
* **Formatting button:** this is another radio button where the user can specify whether they want formatting of their input text to be kept in the output text or not. This input is taken as the `preserve_formatting` argument of the `translate()` function.. \
\

### Example

```{r message = FALSE, results= "hide"}
shiny_translate()
```


### Screenshots

First, the user opens the shiny app to reveal this user interface:\
![User Interface](/Users/margaridamoreirasilva/Documents/GitHub/translate_/screenshots/user_interface.png){width=80%} \
\
On the left side, the user can click on the drop down button to choose the source language or leave it at the "Detect Language" option. The latter option means that the `source_language` argument is not defined and the translator will try to detect the language automatically. \
Below this, there is a text box where the user can write the text they wish to translate. \
Right above the text box is written the language the function is using as the source language. This is especially useful to check when the user uses the "Detect Language" option and wants to check whether the right one was detected. \
![Selecting Source Language](/Users/margaridamoreirasilva/Documents/GitHub/translate_/screenshots/source_language.png){width=40%} \

\
In the middle section, you see two other questions with different options. Here you can define the optional arguments of the function. They are initially set to their default values but you can change them which will update your translation. \
Note that the second button, to choose the level of formality, is not available for every language. This button will only appear if you select a target language that is possible to make more or less formal. For now, these are: Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Polish, Dutch, and Italian. \
![Optional Buttons](/Users/margaridamoreirasilva/Documents/GitHub/translate_/screenshots/middle_buttons.png){width=30%} \
\
Finally, the right section contains another drop down button very similar to the one on the left. Here you can also select from the language options to choose the `target_language`. This choice is necessary so there is no "Detect Language" option. \
Below it there is a box where your translated output will appear. \
![Selecting Target Language](/Users/margaridamoreirasilva/Documents/GitHub/translate_/screenshots/target_language.png){width=40%} \
\
An example of a translation looks like: \

*Note: Since Hungarian was selected as the target language, there is no button to choose the level of formality.* \


## Issues Encountered While Building the Package

* I originally included a **split_sentences** argument in the translate function. It was supposed to split or not several sentences but it didn't seem to be very important. It was hard to tell exactly what that should look like since the online version of the deepl translator doesn't seem to give that option to users anyways. It made me reconsider whether I should keep this argument. It does seem to work with new lines sometimes, but I didn't really see a lot of situations where this would be useful. I ended up removing this argument completely from the `translate()` function since it did almost nothing.\ 
* I included **conditional panels** in the shiny script to be able to only show the buttons to pick the level of formality for the languages that offer this possibility, as selecting anything other than "default" with another language will lead to an error. However, I could not figure out how to make the condition include the whole set of languages that are possible to use. I ended up using one conditional statement and one button per language which resulted in 9 almost identical pieces of code in a row. This seems very inefficient but I tried several ways of making some sort of OR statement but the function would give an error with every method.\
* In terms of testing the `shiny_translate()` function, I struggled to come up with tests that would make sense and not just be re-testing the translate function. I ended up not including any for this function in specific since it takes no inputs and only launches the shinny app whose functioning is entirely dependent on the `translate()` function working properly. \
